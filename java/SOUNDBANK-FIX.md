# Soundbank Management Fixes

## Overview

Based on the debugging and analysis of the BeatGeneratorApp, we've identified and fixed a critical issue causing the application to hang at startup. The problem was a circular dependency between `InternalSynthManager` and `SoundbankManager`, where each manager was trying to initialize the other during startup, leading to an infinite loop.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Circular Dependencies**
   - Modified `InternalSynthManager` constructor to only initialize the synthesizer, not other components that might cause circular dependencies
   - Made `initializeSynthData()` public so it can be explicitly called in the correct order
   - Removed the call to `SoundbankManager.initializeSoundbanks()` from `InternalSynthManager`

2. **Improved Startup Sequence**
   - Updated the App class to initialize components in the correct order:
     1. First initialize the synthesizer (InternalSynthManager)
     2. Then initialize the synthesizer data
     3. Finally load soundbanks (SoundbankManager)

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added more detailed logging to help diagnose initialization issues
   - Made SoundbankManager more resilient to initialization ordering issues

4. **Eliminated Duplicate Operations**
   - Removed duplicate soundbank application in PlayerManager that was causing redundant work

## Remaining Work

1. **Comprehensive Refactoring**
   - Implement the service-based architecture outlined in the REFACTORING-PROPOSAL.md document
   - Clearly separate responsibilities between the manager classes
   - Create proper interfaces to reduce coupling between components

2. **Testing**
   - Develop comprehensive tests for soundbank loading and application
   - Test synthesizer initialization under different conditions
   - Verify that preset changes are properly applied

## Notes

The core issue was that the application was initializing the managers in the wrong order and the managers themselves had circular dependencies. This led to repeated calls to initialize the synthesizer, causing the application to hang.

The new initialization sequence ensures that:
1. The synthesizer is initialized once and only once
2. Each manager has access to the components it needs when it needs them
3. No component tries to use another component before it's fully initialized

This should prevent the application from hanging at startup while maintaining all existing functionality.

# Audio System Refactoring Proposal

## Current Issues

The audio system components have overlapping responsibilities, making the code harder to maintain and understand:

1. **Duplicated functionality** across multiple managers (DeviceManager, ReceiverManager, InternalSynthManager, SoundbankManager)
2. **Unclear responsibilities** between related components
3. **Resource management** scattered across multiple classes
4. **Error handling** inconsistent across the system
5. **Lifecycle management** unclear (initialization, cleanup)

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MidiSystem** - Central facade for all MIDI operations
   - Delegates to specialized managers
   - Provides clean API for the rest of the application
   - Single point of initialization and cleanup

2. **DeviceManager** - Manages MIDI devices
   - Device discovery and selection
   - Device connection management
   - Resource cleanup

3. **SynthesizerManager** - Manages synthesizers
   - Handles internal synthesizer initialization
   - Provides access to synthesizer channels
   - Manages MIDI channel assignment

4. **SoundbankManager** - Manages soundbanks
   - Soundbank loading and management
   - Instrument access and manipulation
   - Preset management

5. **InstrumentManager** - Manages instruments
   - Instrument registration and lookup
   - Instrument parameter management
   - Instrument-to-player mapping

6. **PlayerManager** - Manages players
   - Player creation and configuration
   - Player state management
   - Player-to-channel mapping

### Communication Flow

```
UI Components <-> MidiSystem (facade)
                     |
    +----------------+------------------+
    |                |                  |
DeviceManager  SynthesizerManager  PlayerManager
    |                |                  |
    +----------------+------------------+
                     |
               InstrumentManager
                     |
               SoundbankManager
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create MidiSystem facade**:
   - Single entry point for audio operations
   - Initialization and cleanup orchestration
   - Error handling and recovery

2. **Refactor DeviceManager**:
   - Merge functionality from ReceiverManager
   - Clean up device handling code
   - Improve resource management

3. **Refactor SynthesizerManager**:
   - Merge functionality from InternalSynthManager
   - Centralize synthesizer operations
   - Improve channel management

4. **Refactor SoundbankManager**:
   - Focus solely on soundbank operations
   - Improve soundbank loading and management
   - Simplify preset access

5. **Refactor InstrumentManager**:
   - Clean separation from Player concerns
   - Standardize instrument manipulation
   - Improve instrument caching

6. **Refactor PlayerManager**:
   - Remove instrument-specific code
   - Focus on player state management
   - Improve player-to-channel mapping

## Expected Benefits

1. **Clearer responsibilities** between components
2. **Reduced duplication** of code
3. **Improved error handling** and recovery
4. **Consistent resource management**
5. **Simplified API** for UI components
6. **Enhanced testability**
7. **Easier maintenance** and future development

## Testing Strategy

1. Create unit tests for each refactored component
2. Create integration tests for component interactions
3. Create system tests for end-to-end audio operations
4. Validate against existing functionality
